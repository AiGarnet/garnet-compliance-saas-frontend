# Profile Page Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete profile page with plan management functionality as requested. This includes removing the plan badge from the dashboard header and adding comprehensive plan information and upgrade functionality to the user profile.

## Changes Made

### 1. Header Component (`components/Header.tsx`)
- **Removed**: Plan badge (`SubscriptionTierDisplay`) from the dashboard header
- **Updated**: Profile dropdown link to navigate to `/profile` page
- **Cleaned up**: Import statements and removed unused `SubscriptionTierDisplay` component

### 2. Profile Page (`app/profile/page.tsx`)
- **Created**: Complete profile page with user information and current plan display
- **Features**:
  - User avatar, name, email, role, and organization display
  - Current plan information with proper styling and icons
  - Plan status indicators (Free, Trial, Active, etc.)
  - Trial countdown display when applicable
  - Upgrade button for non-Enterprise plans
  - Success/cancel message handling after Stripe checkout
  - Quick actions sidebar (Settings, Billing, Notifications)

### 3. Integration with Existing Pricing Page (`app/pricing/page.tsx`)
- **Updated**: Enhanced existing pricing page to handle profile redirects
  - Added logic to detect when user comes from profile page
  - Updated success URL to redirect back to profile after successful payment
  - Maintains existing pricing page functionality and design
  - Leverages all existing features (coupons, billing cycles, etc.)

## User Experience Flow

1. **Free Plan User Journey**:
   - User sees clean header without plan badge
   - Navigates to Profile via dropdown
   - Sees current "Free" plan status
   - Clicks "Upgrade" button
   - Redirected to existing pricing page at `/pricing?from=profile&current=starter`
   - Selects desired plan on pricing page
   - Completes Stripe checkout
   - Returns to profile with success message (`/profile?success=true&plan=growth`)
   - Plan information updates automatically

2. **Trial User Journey**:
   - Similar flow but shows trial status and days remaining
   - Upgrade urgency increases as trial expires

3. **Paid Plan User Journey**:
   - Can upgrade to higher tiers
   - Enterprise users see no upgrade option
   - View billing information and next payment date

## Technical Implementation

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Pricing Page Integration**: Redirects to existing `/pricing` page with context
- **Smart Success Redirects**: Returns to profile when upgrade initiated from profile
- **Stripe Integration**: Uses existing `/api/billing/checkout` endpoint
- **Billing Page Integration**: Quick action links to existing `/billing` page
- **URL Parameters**: Passes current plan context via `?from=profile&current=planId`

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/billing/trial-status` - Check trial information
- `GET /api/billing/subscription` - Get current subscription
- `POST /api/billing/checkout` - Create Stripe checkout session

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Proper grid system for desktop/tablet
- Accessible components with proper ARIA labels
- Toast notifications for success/error states

## Security & Performance
- Authentication guard on profile page
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Error handling for API calls
- Loading states for better UX
- Optimistic UI updates

## Future Enhancements
- Settings page implementation
- Billing history view
- Notification preferences
- Account deletion functionality
- Team management (for Enterprise plans)

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Main profile page
- `PROFILE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified:
- `components/Header.tsx` - Removed plan badge, updated profile link
- `app/pricing/page.tsx` - Added profile redirect logic for success URLs

### Removed:
- `components/profile/PlanUpgradeModal.tsx` - Custom modal (replaced with existing pricing page)

## Testing
The implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase and uses the same authentication, styling, and API patterns. All components are properly typed and follow React best practices.

To test:
1. Navigate to `/profile` when logged in
2. Verify plan information displays correctly
3. Test upgrade flow with different plans
4. Verify success/cancel flow after Stripe checkout
5. Check mobile responsiveness
