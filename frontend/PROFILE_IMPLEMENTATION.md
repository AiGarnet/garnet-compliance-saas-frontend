# Profile Page Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete profile page with plan management functionality as requested. This includes removing the plan badge from the dashboard header and adding comprehensive plan information and upgrade functionality to the user profile.

## Changes Made

### 1. Header Component (`components/Header.tsx`)
- **Removed**: Plan badge (`SubscriptionTierDisplay`) from the dashboard header
- **Updated**: Profile dropdown link to navigate to `/profile` page
- **Cleaned up**: Import statements and removed unused `SubscriptionTierDisplay` component

### 2. Profile Page (`app/profile/page.tsx`)
- **Created**: Complete profile page with user information and current plan display
- **Features**:
  - User avatar, name, email, role, and organization display
  - Current plan information with proper styling and icons
  - Plan status indicators (Free, Trial, Active, etc.)
  - Trial countdown display when applicable
  - Upgrade button for non-Enterprise plans
  - Success/cancel message handling after Stripe checkout
  - Quick actions sidebar with functional links to Settings and Billing pages

### 3. Settings Page (`app/settings/page.tsx`)
- **Created**: Comprehensive settings page with tabbed interface
  - **Profile Tab**: Update name, email, organization info
  - **Security Tab**: Change password, two-factor authentication setup
  - **Preferences Tab**: Language, timezone, account deletion
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Success/error message system
  - Password visibility toggles
  - Account deletion confirmation modal

### 4. Integration with Existing Pricing Page (`app/pricing/page.tsx`)
- **Updated**: Enhanced existing pricing page to handle profile redirects
  - Added logic to detect when user comes from profile page
  - Updated success URL to redirect back to profile after successful payment
  - Maintains existing pricing page functionality and design
  - Leverages all existing features (coupons, billing cycles, etc.)

## User Experience Flow

1. **Free Plan User Journey**:
   - User sees clean header without plan badge
   - Navigates to Profile via dropdown
   - Sees current "Free" plan status
   - Clicks "Upgrade" button
   - Redirected to existing pricing page at `/pricing?from=profile&current=starter`
   - Selects desired plan on pricing page
   - Completes Stripe checkout
   - Returns to profile with success message (`/profile?success=true&plan=growth`)
   - Plan information updates automatically

2. **Trial User Journey**:
   - Similar flow but shows trial status and days remaining
   - Upgrade urgency increases as trial expires

3. **Paid Plan User Journey**:
   - Can upgrade to higher tiers
   - Enterprise users see no upgrade option
   - View billing information and next payment date
   - Access full settings functionality

4. **Settings Management**:
   - Navigate to Settings from Profile quick actions or header dropdown
   - Update profile information (name, organization)
   - Change password with current password verification
   - Set language and timezone preferences
   - Account deletion with confirmation modal

## Technical Implementation

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Pricing Page Integration**: Redirects to existing `/pricing` page with context
- **Smart Success Redirects**: Returns to profile when upgrade initiated from profile
- **Stripe Integration**: Uses existing `/api/billing/checkout` endpoint
- **Billing Page Integration**: Quick action links to existing `/billing` page
- **URL Parameters**: Passes current plan context via `?from=profile&current=planId`

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/billing/trial-status` - Check trial information
- `GET /api/billing/subscription` - Get current subscription
- `POST /api/billing/checkout` - Create Stripe checkout session
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile information
- `POST /api/auth/change-password` - Change user password

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Proper grid system for desktop/tablet
- Accessible components with proper ARIA labels
- Toast notifications for success/error states

## Security & Performance
- Authentication guard on profile page
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Error handling for API calls
- Loading states for better UX
- Optimistic UI updates

## Future Enhancements
- Two-factor authentication implementation
- Billing history view
- Team management (for Enterprise plans)
- API key management
- Data export functionality

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Main profile page
- `app/settings/page.tsx` - Comprehensive settings page
- `PROFILE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified:
- `components/Header.tsx` - Removed plan badge, updated profile/settings links
- `app/pricing/page.tsx` - Added profile redirect logic for success URLs

### Removed:
- `components/profile/PlanUpgradeModal.tsx` - Custom modal (replaced with existing pricing page)

## Testing
The implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase and uses the same authentication, styling, and API patterns. All components are properly typed and follow React best practices.

To test:
1. Navigate to `/profile` when logged in
2. Verify plan information displays correctly
3. Test upgrade flow with different plans
4. Verify success/cancel flow after Stripe checkout
5. Navigate to `/settings` and test all tabs
6. Test profile updates and password changes
7. Test language and timezone preferences
8. Check mobile responsiveness on both pages
